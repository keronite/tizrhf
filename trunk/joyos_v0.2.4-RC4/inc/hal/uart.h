 * \brief UART (USB serial port) functionality.
 *
 * The Happyboard has a FT232RL USB serial bridge chip on board, which makes it
 * appear as a serial port on most OS's (Windows/Mac/Linux). Users can print 
 * information to the UART and monitor it on a computer using a terminal 
 * emulator program such as hyperterminal or minicom.
 *
 * The Happyboard configures the UART for 19200 baud, 8N1.
