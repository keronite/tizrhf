status_enum: SUCCESS, FAILURE_RETURN, FAILURE_CONTINUE
-I don't know if failure_continue is useful, but it means goal was not accomplished, but move on.

NODE:
Node*[] children
status_enum attempt()

Inheritance:
Travel_Node(goal_pos)
Flag_Node
Acquire_Node
Goal_Node
Line_Node(end_dist, orientation), or a line enum?

Methods made available:
calculate_abs_pos()
travel_to(x,y)
line_follow()
get_ball()
turn(angle)
drive(distance)
get_angle()
dump_balls()
thrash()

Goal_manager (maybe just main)
current_node
try_child(i)

Has current node
Tries children until success or failure_continue
Winning child becomes next current node
If no children win, thrash and try again.  maybe increase duration if occurs more than once

global vars:
x
y
angle
uncertainty? - increases over time when using shaft encoders and moving, resets when sharp distance
anger? - increases with failures, resets with successes.  Violence of thrashing, aggressiveness
