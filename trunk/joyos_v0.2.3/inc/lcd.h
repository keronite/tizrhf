/**
 * \file lcd.h
 * \brief LCD control, formatting, printout.
 *
 * The happyboard LCD is a 2x16 character device. The OS code treats the LCD as
 * a single 1x32 line display. This means that printf("012345690123456789") 
 * will display:
 *
 * \code
 *         +----------------+
 * line 1: |0123456789012345|
 * line 2: |6789            |
 *         +----------------+
 * \endcode
 *
 * For general LCD printing, printf() is suggested. printf() is a wrapper around
 * the functions documented below. As such these functions should only be used 
 * when printf() is insufficient.
 *
 * Printing a newline character ("\n" in C) to the display clears it. Thus, 
 * printf("hello world\n"), will not display anything (the display is cleared 
 * after the text is displayed). Instead, you should use printf("\nhello world")
 * - this will clear the display and then display the text.
 *
 * The OS will occasionally use the bottom right character of the display for 
 * warning/information icons, which may obscure user printouts (if they use the
 * full 32 characters of the display).
 *
 * The LCD supports 8 user-defined characters. On startup these characters are 
 * set to a system defaults as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * 0: unsused
 * 1: smiley face
 * 2: alternate smiley face
 * 3: frowny face
 * 4: low battery indicator
 * 5: loading indicator
 * 6: bootloader indicator
 * 7: unused
 * \endcode
 *
 * These special characters can be reconfigured by the user with the 
 * lcd_set_custom_char() function, as long as you remember this will change the
 * OS warning indicator icons.
