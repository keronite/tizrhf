/**
 * \file pid.h
 * \brief Generic PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller
 * implementation.
 *
 * A PID is a commonly used feedback mechanism used to correct error
 * between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. 
 *
 * A Common use in robotics (especially in 6.270) is the position control 
 * of a motor. In this case the process variable is the wheels angular 
 * position, and the setpoint is a desired target position (eg: 720 degrees, 
 * or two wheel rotations forward). The wheel position is measured with shaft
 * encoders and the motor is commanded by the PID controller to compensate
 * for the error between the current wheel position and the desired goal.
 *
 * This allows the user to command a desired amount of wheel rotation (and
 * hence distance travelled). With a PID controller on each wheel the user
 * can perform reasonably accurate motions (straight lines, in place turns,
 * etc).
 *
 *
