 * \brief Analog Inputs
 *
 * The Happyboard has 16 analog inputs. These inputs are fed into a 10
 * Bit ADC. The ADC communicates with the main processor via SPI, and 
 * can do so at 500kHz (20k samples per second.) In reality the 
 * actual maximum sample rate is slightly lower due to overheads in the OS code.
 * (Also, the bottleneck analog input sampling is usually processing code, 
 * rather than the actual data acquisition).
 *
 * The analog, digital, and encoder inputs (as well as the LCD) are run off a 
 * separate 5V regulated supply. This supply can supply up to 400mA to power 
 * the input sensors.
